    "The Guardians of the Galaxy are a band of outlaws who joined to protect the galaxy from threats. The group's founding members are Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Groot. The team's membership is later expanded with the addition of Mantis while temporarily aided by Yondu Udonta and Nebula in their fight against Ego. Kraglin also assists the team in the final confrontation.[28] Four years later, they aid Thor and the Avengers in confronting Thanos in his attempt to collect the six Infinity Stones. Thanos succeeds in collecting all of Stones, murdering Gamora in the process, and disintegrates half of all life in the universe, with Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, and Groot among his victims, with only Rocket and Nebula spared",
    "Marvel Comics' Avengers are a large group of individual super heroes that have joined forces to protect the world from threats they cannot face alone. The idea of individual costumed champions banding together for the greater good is a simple but powerful one, and by aligning the Avengers haven't just protected their world -- they've changed it. There are now super teams all over the globe with an interest in protecting the people of their home nations and the world from weird and fantastic menaces.",
    "Coming in hot on the heels of Spider-Man: No Way Home is Doctor Strange's second film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The second trailer for the film recently dropped, and there's a LOT to unpack. New heroes are introduced and old favorites return. Alliances are tested as variants of characters make their appearances and reality as they know it is ripped apart to an extent worse than in WandaVision and No Way Home.",
